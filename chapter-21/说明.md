## 21-1

**实现abort()。**

根据manual手册进行实现即可：

```plain text
The abort() function first unblocks the SIGABRT signal, and then raises
that signal for the calling process (as though  raise(3)  was  called).
This  results  in  the  abnormal  termination of the process unless the
SIGABRT signal is caught and the signal handler does  not  return  (see
longjmp(3)).

If  the SIGABRT signal is ignored, or caught by a handler that returns,
the abort() function will still terminate the process.  It does this by
restoring the default disposition for SIGABRT and then raising the sig\
nal for a second time.
```

我写了两种测试情况：SIGABRT被阻塞和局部跳转。前者abort会成功，后者abort会失败。SIGABRT被忽略的情况就不测试了。

SIGABRT被阻塞：

```shell
mayuri@mayuri-virtual-machine:~/文档/21$ g++ -o 21-1 21-1.cpp
mayuri@mayuri-virtual-machine:~/文档/21$ ./21-1
when SIGABRT is ignored:
SIGABRT has successfully been ignored:
已放弃 (核心已转储)
```

可以看到abort成功了。

局部跳转：

```shell
mayuri@mayuri-virtual-machine:~/文档/21$ ./21-1 | head -n 10
when nonlocal:
sigsetjmp has been called
SIGABRT has been caught
jumped from SIGABRT handler
SIGABRT has been caught
jumped from SIGABRT handler
SIGABRT has been caught
jumped from SIGABRT handler
SIGABRT has been caught
jumped from SIGABRT handler
```

因为会无限循环所有只截取了前10条，可以看到abort确实没成功。
